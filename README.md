## Learning Points 


Through this project, I learned a lot about how HTML and CSS interact and how to format and design a clean looking website. I used tools such as flexbox and media queries to achieve this.

It was a challenge learning how everything interacts and starting from scratch, but I learned a lot from this project and intend to keep upgrading it as I grow my skills.
